# Internal Competition 2022
### All code to help you get started with Internal Competition will be stored here. This code includes but is not limited to:
- The front-end SDK to render components for your controller
- Communications code templates to send information between your robot's Raspberry Pi and the controlling device
- Content and sample programs from the Software workshops

## How Everything Comes Together
The SBRT 2022 Internal Competition, ***The Hunt***, is a competition designed to draw many parallels to our external competition in order to garner support, train our members and also create an entertaining event for both participants and an audience. We hope that through this competition, we can foster a sense of camaraderie within our new and older members. 

Participants are tasked with:
### Mechanical Tasks
- Creating and designing a robot chassis
- Creating and designing a grabber mechanism to collect items in the scavenger hunt
### Electrical Tasks
- Wiring up the motor controller and motors
- Providing a power network for the motors and electronics for the grabber mechanism
### Software Tasks
- Writing a motor/servo controlling [Python script](client/controls.py)
- Writing a [Web App aka Frontend](client/controller/) to send commands to the Python script
- **See the [tutorial](./client/README.md) if you are confused on the software tasks**
